</p>

**PantryDjango** is an application that helps users keep track of the food items in their refrigerator and pantry — so they don’t miss expiration dates or waste food!  
It’s designed to reduce food waste and improve kitchen organization, making everyday life a little fresher and more efficient.

The goal of this project is to build a **practical** and **user-friendly** grocery inventory manager using **ASP.NET Core** and **Microsoft SQL Server**, with **GitHub** used for source control.

## Acknowledgements

It was inspired by my mom, who loves to keep our fridge and pantry well-stocked... maybe *a little* too well-stocked.   
The name "PantryDjango" is a playful nod to the cool Quentin Tarantino film *Django*, and also to the way "refrigerator" (냉장고) sounds in Korean.
